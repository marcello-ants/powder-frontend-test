# Frontend Interview

This test is a part of our hiring process at Powder for the Frontend Developer position. It should take you between 4 to 6 hours, depending on your experience, to implement the minimal version.

## Exercise

The application must be built using [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). We do use React/TS on our Electron/Web Apps.

You are free to choose whatever styling technology/methodology you'd like to build the application, we do use a BEM inspired methodology implemented using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) & [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

This application must:

- Match the [mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/jupkhmJX9J2ErE5O9NPOg4/Frontend---Interview) (`mockups.pdf`), but pixel-perfect is not a goal
- Display all the videos of a given category, `See All` will be clickable
- Allow users to play videos
- Be responsive, it must be friendly with small & big screens
- Be maintainable, it must allow other teammates to contribute to the code base

_NOTE: Rounded buttons don't have to do anything._
